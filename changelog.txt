## [Unreleased]
### Added
- added optional flag on the 'BodyForce' constructor to coose whether to 
    simplify the resulting expresion
### Changed
- updated octave / python print methods to utilise common sub expersion 
    decompositon. This significantly increase the performance of the generated 
    EoMs
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed

## [0.1.4.2] - 2021-04-07
### Added
- first commit to moyra: this software was created to easily create the EoMs of
    basic nonlinear aeroelastic systems using the symbolic library sympy
- added methods the create multibody elements and forces and create the EoMs via
    the Euler-Lagrange method
- support to generate forces from basic strip theory
- ability to print the generated symbolic EoMs to either numpy or MATLAB/Octave 
    to use the EoM with numerical methods
